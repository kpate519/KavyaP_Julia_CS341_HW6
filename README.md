# Julia Flower Plot Demo

This repository contains a simple Julia script that creates a colorful flower-like plot using the Plots.jl
 package. The script generates multiple layers of petals with varying colors and sizes, resulting in a beautiful, smooth flower visualization.

# Features

Uses polar coordinates to create petal shapes.

Multiple layers with different numbers of petals and colors.

Central yellow circle representing the flower's core.

Saves the plot as a PNG image (flower.png).

# Usage

Install Julia: If you haven't already, download and install Julia from julialang.org
.

Install the Plots package:
Open Julia REPL and run:

import Pkg
Pkg.add("Plots")


# Run the script:
Save the code in a file named flower_plot.jl, then run it using:

julia flower_plot.jl


This will display the flower plot and save an image flower.png in the current directory.

# Code Explanation

The plot uses a range of angles θ from 0 to 
2π to draw smooth petals.

Each layer of petals is generated by calculating a radius r based on a sine function with varying frequency and scale.

Polar coordinates (r, θ) are converted to Cartesian (x, y) for plotting.

Petal layers use different colors and line widths to add depth.

A yellow circle is added at the center as the flower's core.
